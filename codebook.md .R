The variables that I used were the featureNames and the activityLabels because 
they were the two metadatas of the project within the UCI Har datasets. 


In the UCI Har Dataset there are two folders that contain the information of test 
and train. 

Part 1 is to merge the datasets of both train and test to create one dataset 



Part 4: This variable, extracteddata, is showing the information from the data 
set.

Part 5: extractedData is used and within addition of subject.
